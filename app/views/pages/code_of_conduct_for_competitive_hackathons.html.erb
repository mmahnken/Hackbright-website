					<center><h3></span> Code of Conduct For Competitive Hackathons </span></h3></center>
					</br >
					<p>This hackathon is a community event intended for innovation, collaboration, and engagement in the developer community.</p>
					<p>We value the participation of each member of the developer community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the event.</p>
					<p>To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, and volunteers at the event event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.
					</p>

					<p><span class="placement-point">Be Respectful</span></br> Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and racist, sexist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event*. </p>
					<p><span font-style="italic;">* Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</span></p>

					<p><span class="placement-point">Be Thoughtful</span><br/> In the spirit of innovation and inclusiveness, there may be minors participating in the event. Keep this in mind when choosing a location to work, and mention to the organizers that your content is explicit if youâ€™d like to submit for judging. You will be pitching to judges and other attendees after the non-explicit content.  You will present your idea to an audience who is explicitly prepared to experience your presentation in a safe and/or designated area.</p>

					<p><span class="placement-point">Be Open</span> <br/>We welcome attendees from all backgrounds. This event is about increasing the overall amount of innovation, partnership, and engagement in the developer community.

					<p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the hackathon at the sole discretion of the hackathon organizers. <br/>
						Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
