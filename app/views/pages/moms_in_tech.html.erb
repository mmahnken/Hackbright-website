			<center><h3> Goals </h3></center>
			</br >
			<ul>
			<li>Our goals at Hackbright Academy are to be the best place to become a software
			engineer and to help more women become software engineers. That’s why
			Hackbright Academy is exclusively for women. It’s been quite the journey so far! We’ve helped over
			50 women break into the industry with confidence, relationships, and skills that will
			last a lifetime. We’ve worked with many great companies over the past year, and
			most recently, we’ve begun working with Facebook.</li>
			</br>
			<li>Facebook also cares deeply about helping more women succeed as software
			engineers. Today, we’re excited to announce a special sponsorship with Facebook for
			women who have taken a career break from tech — the Moms in Tech Sponsorship.</li>
			</br>
			<li>There are many women who have started successful careers in tech who choose to
			put their career on hold to dedicate more time to their children and families. When
			these women think about returning to work, we want to help them lean back in to
			their careers with the most up-to-date skill set and technical abilities. <strong>The Facebook
			Moms in Tech Sponsorship will cover the full $12,000 tuition to Hackbright</strong> where
			these women will be able to refresh their technical skills and learn entirely new
			ones so they’re well-equipped to rejoin the workforce.</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
