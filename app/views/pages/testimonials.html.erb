				<p>I don't mean to sound cheesy, but making the decision to go through Hackbright really changed my life. I went in to the program with a small amount of experience picking up HTML and CSS on my own from working with existing websites. Some in my class had literally no experience. That's what it's made for, so you absolutely can go in with no prior experience at all and come out with a job as a developer, if you are able and willing to adapt to a developer's mindset and work to learn and improve constantly -- the same challenges you face during Hackbright are what engineers encounter in their jobs every day. <br /><br /> I found that the strength of my knowledge and the projects I had on GitHub and my resume coming out of Hackbright were definitely enough to be considered for entry-level positions in many companies in the bay area, and I had several offers after the program. That said, I think one big perception change that we all went through at/after Hackbright was from seeing the program as the tangible laundry list of skills/benefits like Python, pair programming, job interview -- to understanding it really as a chance to lay the foundation for understanding development and technology in a more general sense, and be prepared to enter the industry and continue learning new things, as all good developers do. I believe the main goal of the program is not to get a job placement, but to learn the fundamentals of development -- the instructor Christian really cares about the students and wants them to be able to do everything they might want to do in the future, from mobile/web/software development, to gaining more experience and learning to design databases or become a CTO. So I think it's really a great way to learn a ton, expand your network, and show that you're serious about taking part in the technical community, and from that, if you want a job you should be able to get one.</p>

					<h5>Christian</h5>
					<p>Christian grew up on the tropical island of American Samoa, learning to hunt eels in the coral reefs. He applied those skills later to write assembly code to blit bitmaps in mode 13h (doing graphics with assembly is a lot like eel-wrangling). These days, he's hung up his eel gloves in favor of building network applications and teaching programming. He's been a senior software developer at Kivera (acquired by TCS), Ask, and Fuzebox.</br ></br >He's also a founding member and resident python instructor at Ace Monster Toys, an educational hackerspace in Oakland, and was an instructor for the inaugural class of Dev Bootcamp. Christian holds a B.S. in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
